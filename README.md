What I expect from this Module :brain: :
1. Learn how to code
2. Get a basic understanding of how programming works
3. Apply this knowledge to other projects

How it is going so far (Week1) :bug: :
- 1st session was quite a lot
- still a little confusing
- but so far with enough time (& patience) the codes work
